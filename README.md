## 🚀 New: Cloud-Native TSaaS Platform for Freqtrade — AI-Enhanced + Developer-Controlled

Hey everyone 👋

We’re excited to introduce something the Freqtrade community has needed for a long time:

A **cloud-native, AI-powered TSaaS platform** that lets you build, test, and run your Freqtrade strategies in the cloud — instantly.

No more CLI headaches, YAML tuning, or DevOps fire drills.

---

### 🚀 What It Is

This platform lets you:

- ✅ **Upload or build your own `strategy.py`**
- ✅ **Auto-deploy live or paper bots with 1-click Kubernetes orchestration**
- ✅ **Use AI tools to:**
  - Generate new strategies from scratch (GPT-powered)
  - Add fragility filters and pre-positioning risk models *(coming soon)*
- ✅ **View real-time candle charts + trade overlays via a hosted TradingView interface**
- ✅ **Export your bot + strategy if you prefer to self-host** — you keep full control
- ✅ **Works 100% with native Freqtrade strategies and config**

---

### 🔐 Open Source Compliance & Privacy

- We use Freqtrade (GPLv3) as the core engine
- Our platform is a hosted service — no code redistribution = GPL compliant
- Your strategies and API keys stay private — we never log or share them
- You can export your logic anytime, including Dockerfile templates for self-hosting

---

### 📈 Who It’s For

- Developers who want to focus on strategy, not infrastructure
- Algo traders looking for AI tooling without black-box lock-in
- Teams or creators running multiple bots who need real-time oversight
- Freqtrade users who want an upgrade path to production trading

### 🛠️ Built For the Freqtrade Ecosystem

We’re Freqtrade-native by design — this isn’t a wrapper. You can:

- Deploy any Freqtrade-compatible `strategy.py`
- Use your existing `config.json`
- Mount external datasets
- Get full log access per bot (via WebSockets and Kubernetes)
