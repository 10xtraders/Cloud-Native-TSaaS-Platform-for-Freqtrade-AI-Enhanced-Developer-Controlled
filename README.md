## 🚀 New: Cloud-Native TSaaS Platform for Freqtrade — AI-Enhanced + Developer-Controlled

Hey everyone 👋

We’re excited to introduce something the Freqtrade community has needed for a long time:

A [**cloud-native, AI-powered TSaaS platform**](https://10xtraders.ai) that lets you build, test, and run your Freqtrade strategies in the cloud — instantly.

No more CLI headaches, YAML tuning, or DevOps fire drills.

### 🚀 What It Is

This platform lets you:

- ✅ **Upload or build your own `strategy with AI`**
- ✅ **Auto-deploy live or paper bots with 1-click Kubernetes orchestration**
- ✅ **Use AI tools to:**
  - Generate new strategies from scratch (GPT-powered)
  - Add fragility filters and pre-positioning risk models *(coming soon)*
- ✅ **View real-time candle charts + trade overlays via TradingView charts**
- ✅ **Export your bot + strategy if you prefer to self-host** — you keep full control
- ✅ **Works 100% with native Freqtrade strategies and config**
